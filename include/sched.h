 * ACTIVE - The task that has just run, is running, or is about to run. On a single processor only one task can be active at a time
 * READY - The task is ready to be activated

 * SEND_BLOCKED - The task has executed Receive(), and is waiting for a task to sent to it
 * RECEIVE_BLOCKED - The task has executed Send(), and is waiting for the message to be received
 * REPLY_BLOCKED - The task has executed Send() and its message has been received, but it has not received a reply
 * EVENT_BLOCKED - The task has executed AwaitEvent(), but the event on which it is waiting has not occurred
